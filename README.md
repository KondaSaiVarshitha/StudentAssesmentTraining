Introduction
The Student Assessment Training project aims to streamline the process of tracking student performance and assigning appropriate modules and trainers. It helps educational institutions manage their training programs effectively, ensuring that students receive the modules best suited to their progress.

Features
Student Performance Tracking: The project allows tracking student performance through various assessments and progress metrics.
Module Assignment: Based on the student's performance, the system assigns relevant training modules.
Trainer Assignment: Trainers are assigned to students based on the specific modules they are responsible for.
RESTful API: The project provides a RESTful API for easy integration with other systems.
Technologies Used
Spring Boot
Java
MySQL
RestAPI
Setup
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK)
MySQL Server
Gradle or Maven (for building and managing dependencies)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentAssessmentTraining.git
cd StudentAssessmentTraining
Configure the MySQL database:

Create a new database named student_assessment_db.
Update the application.properties file located in the src/main/resources directory with your database connection details.
Build and run the project:

Using Gradle:

bash
Copy code
./gradlew bootRun
Using Maven:

arduino
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run
The project should now be up and running.

Usage
Access the project's API endpoints (see API Endpoints) using a tool like Postman or through your web browser.

Perform assessments for students and track their progress.

The system will automatically assign relevant modules and trainers based on the student's performance.
